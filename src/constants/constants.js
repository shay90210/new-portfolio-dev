The project is primarily coded using JavaScript functions to increment/decrement items, remove items, and hold items in a basket when the page refreshes. \nWhile I have only been coding for 9 months before deploying this site, I still believed that it had potential for improvement such making the website more responsive to other designs, adding an authentication for login users/repeat customers, and adding a payment feature. This project will be revamped using JavaScript and React.",

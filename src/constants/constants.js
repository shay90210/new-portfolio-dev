To rectify the intricacies that I faced and ensure a more successful project, I redid this project using React and Typescript to ensure that each step that I code improves my editor support and catches mistakes before any runtime for testing. This project features adding items to cart, incrementing/decrementing items, removing items and a cart summary on an offcanvas component that shows the price, total, and # of items in the cart. ",

The website uses JavaScript functions to increment/decrement items, remove items, and hold items in a basket when the page refreshes. While I recognize that there is potential for improvement, such as adding an authentication for login users/repeat customers and a payment feature, I am proud of what I accomplished with just 9 months of coding experience. I am currently revamping the project using JavaScript and React to make the website more responsive and efficient.",

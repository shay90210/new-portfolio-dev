    description: "I created The Teachers' Club, an e-commerce website that sells teacher apparel, as my first deployed website. The website uses JavaScript functions to increment/decrement items, remove items, and hold items in a basket when the page refreshes. While I recognize that there is potential for improvement, such as adding an authentication for login users/repeat customers and a payment feature, I am proud of what I accomplished with just 9 months of coding experience. I am currently revamping the project using JavaScript and React to make the website more responsive and efficient.",
